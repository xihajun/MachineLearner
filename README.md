# MachineLearner
To collect different machine learning algorithms here for future revision

## Let's talk about Math
- Maxium likelihood: just to get a best Θ which can `MAX P(X|Θ)`. 
    - To do this we can the derivation of the function `P(X|Θ)`, usually `log` is a useful way to get rid of the exponential component for things like gaussian distribution.
## Probabilistic Graphical Model
I've learnt that from [Carl's machine learning course](https://github.com/carlhenrikek/COMS30007) in 2018-2019. Just want to have a deep understanding now in 2020. It is easy to forget things if you don't use that. But I am still need to find a key that how to recap it quickly. (I reckon I should use emacs to edit those now, but I feel that emacs editor is not really good for doing this job?)

## Clustering
### DBSCAN

- **keywords: core, border, outlier, eps, min_sample**
- Youtube videos: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3r7tGRe2eI), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cOhL4B5waU)
- Jupyter notebooks: [1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/papayawarrior/public_talks/blob/master/pydata_nyc_DeBaCl.ipynb), [2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/papayawarrior/public_talks/blob/master/pydata_nyc_dbscan.ipynb)
- explained core label in DBSCAN algorithm
- issue #2: dbscan result

### Neural Network

- issue #1: tensorflow - fit for one sample always give me error?

## Point estimator
- MME
    - bias on (uniform distribution)

- MLE
## Test statistic
I learned test statistic from Partick's anomaly detection course[[notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9ODwgzxZIv8fjdpc1ozZXd5WTZObGYyeVV3d0JtYVdPSnJXamdJUWxQRklFMjJITVJUU1E?usp=sharing)]. At the beginning, I have no idea what it is. Thanks to a course from Taiwai（劉惠美－數理統計學）which could be found [here](http://ctld.video.nccu.edu.tw/media/751). 老师在第一节课中说统计中有两个概念：点估计和假设检验。

- rejection region
    - issue #3: how to transfer the region to a probability
- examples: different variance

## Others
This section will cover things I don't really understand and hopefully I can add as much as possible and fit them into normal sections
***
When I did my interview at Oxford University, they asked me some questions that I cannot answer. (which means that I still have too much to learn!)
### VC dimention
TODO: learn & update VC dimention part (due by: 25th Aug)
### Autoencoder stuff
TODO: add things
