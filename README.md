# MachineLearner
To collect different machine learning algorithms here for future revision

## Let's talk about Math
- Maxium likelihood: just to get a best Θ which can `MAX P(X|Θ)`. 
    - To do this we can the derivation of the function `P(X|Θ)`, usually `log` is a useful way to get rid of the exponential component for things like gaussian distribution.

## Clustering
### DBSCAN

- **keywords: core, border, outlier, eps, min_sample**
- Youtube videos: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3r7tGRe2eI), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cOhL4B5waU)
- Jupyter notebooks: [1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/papayawarrior/public_talks/blob/master/pydata_nyc_DeBaCl.ipynb), [2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/papayawarrior/public_talks/blob/master/pydata_nyc_dbscan.ipynb)
- explained core label in DBSCAN algorithm
- issue #2: dbscan result

### Neural Network

- issue #1: tensorflow - fit for one sample always give me error?
 
## Test statistic
I learned test statistic from Partick anomaly detection course. At the beginning, I have no idea what it is. Thanks to a course from Taiwai（劉惠美－數理統計學） which could be found [here](http://ctld.video.nccu.edu.tw/media/751).

- rejection region
    - issue #3: how to transfer the region to a probability
- examples: different variance

## Others
This section will cover things I don't really understand and hopefully I can add as much as possible and fit them into normal sections
***
When I did my interview at Oxford University, they asked me some questions that I cannot answer. (which means that I still have too much to learn!)
### VC dimention
TODO: learn & update VC dimention part (due by: 15th Aug)
### Autoencoder stuff
TODO: add things
