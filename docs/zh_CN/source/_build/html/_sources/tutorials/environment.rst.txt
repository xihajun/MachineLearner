1.1 Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a ``Dockerfile`` to make life easier. If you follow the docker usage, you could build it up easily.

1.2 Build your own environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't like docker, don't worry, ``pip install`` would be a savior.

    # run it in your terminal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py install
