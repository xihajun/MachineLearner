Installation
=============

Let's get started by setting up our environment to run the snake.

1.1 Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The baby version of cobra is sensitive, and it could only be happy when living with python 3.7 or newer. So please set a nice environment to make sure it is happy.

1.2 Working environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will have two options to keep cobra happy:

- using docker
- building up own working environment

See more details from :ref:`environment`.
