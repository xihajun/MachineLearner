.. caution:: YOU ARE BE IN SS-ZOO. THERE MAY BE COBRA IN THIS AREA.

********
Overview
********

COBRA would be an excellent TF targets hunter based on its highly developed sense of smell for ChIP-seq and excellent sense of touch for RNA-seq. However, this is also a greedy snake. In order to let COBRA become your reliable partener, we highly recommond to feed at least 20 ChIP-seq experiments for it. Once COBRA gets enough feeds from users, it could do some cool stuffs, like dotplot painting. Why not have one yourself? Check this page out to see how it works now! 

.. COBRA apples a probabilistic model, which integrates cistromes obtained from TF binding ChIP-seq data and differential gene expression, to compute the target probability based on the experiments. The whole process could be divided by four main steps: high confidence peak clustering, binding site scoring, differential expression analysis, and integration.

Why the name COBRA?

Actually, you can find lots of ways to make sense of COBRA. Here are the ideas we have:

- Literally: Combined Binding and Regulatory Analysis.
- It is written in python.

About SS-ZOO
*************

Welcome! Our SS-ZOO visitor! Based on our knowledge base, we think you are likely to be an bioinformatician who might also interested in finding out what kind of other animals do we have. We currently have ``SpideR``, ``COBRA``. Our new members - ``Priranha``, ``FROGS`` -  will be coming soon! You can check out our `lab page <https://www.samarajiwa-lab.org/>`_ to find out more.
